# 1.1: (5/5)

Great work and write-up.

Comments:
* Can remove the "L" from the code by dividing through.
* Usually we use $\lambda$ for charge density on a line.
* I typically provide a log for each iteration if the number of iterations is small. Sometimes something unexpected happens that reveals an error.

# 1.2: (4.5/5)

The integral can be evaluated.

Comment:
* Most authors use `$\cos$` instead of `$cos$`. Can do this for all trig and log functions.

I like your idea for an example, but it is not quite correct. You assumed the field due to the fine line was $E=kQ_{total}/r^2$, but this is only true in the limit of $r/L\rightarrow \infty$.

One idea is to use your code for problem 1.1 to compute the average of $\mathbf{E}\cdot r_{hat}$ on a grid of points on the surface of a sphere of radius, say, $4L$. This a average times $4\pi$ should equal $2L\sigma$.
