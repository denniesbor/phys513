1. 5/5

Should plot all curves on the same axes so that you can verify limits.

2. 5/5

3. 3/5

In parts 1-3, need to explicilty use Gauss' law and state what the surface of integration is. In all cases, you made large leaps in logic and omitted justification. See solution for details.

In part 4, should be -kQ/r^2. Charge on inner shell is negative. However, you corrected this in the plot.

4. 4/5

In region 3., the potential should vary with r.
